    'Carbon-free" refers to activities and technologies that do not produce carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) emissions, a major cause of climate change. This includes using renewable energy sources like solar and wind, driving electric vehicles, and employing energy-efficient appliances. Sustainable practices, such as reducing waste and recycling, also help lower carbon footprints. Additionally, carbon offsetting projects like reforestation compensate for any unavoidable emissions. By adopting these methods, we can work towards a carbon-free future and a healthier planet! ';
